🔍 Problem Statement:
Blinkit, a fast-growing e-commerce grocery platform, wanted to improve decision-making across sales, pricing, and outlet performance by analyzing sales data across multiple dimensions. However, they lacked a centralized, visual platform to:

Track sales performance by product categories like Breakfast, Beverages, Dairy, etc.

Compare performance by Outlet Type (e.g., Supermarket Type1) and Location Tier (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2).

Analyze monthly and yearly sales trends and patterns.

Monitor the visibility, weight, and fat content distribution of sold items.

Empower business managers with an interactive filtering system to drive data-driven strategies.

🧠 Solution Overview:
To address this, I developed a dynamic and visually intuitive Power BI Dashboard that allows users to explore insights in real-time. Here's how I solved it:

🟡 Key Features & Insights:
KPIs Section:

🛒 Outlet Sales – Total sales across outlets

💲 Item Price – Average selling price per item

📦 Total Sales Per Unit – Aggregated unit-level sales

🧁 Item Type Count – Total unique item types in the category

Monthly Trend Analysis:

Line + Bar combo chart showing Outlet Sales and Item Type count across months.

Helps understand seasonal demand and product category fluctuations.

Item Attribute Distribution:

A pie chart presenting the distribution of Item Type, Fat Content, Visibility, and Weight.

Useful for identifying inventory patterns and optimizing product offerings.

Year-wise Sales Performance:

A bar chart comparing Sales vs Year of Establishment.

Helps correlate outlet age with revenue trends.

Advanced Filtering:

Dropdown filters for:

✅ Item Type (e.g., Breakfast)

✅ Outlet Location Type (e.g., Tier 2)

✅ Outlet Type (e.g., Supermarket Type1)

Left slicer for month selection (December, June, May, etc.)

💡 Business Impact:
✅ Enables real-time insights into outlet and item performance
✅ Drives better inventory planning, pricing, and marketing strategies
✅ Helps identify high-performing categories and months
✅ Supports data-driven decisions for supply chain and regional planning
